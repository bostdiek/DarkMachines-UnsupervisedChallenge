# DarkMachines-UnsupervisedChallenge

## Abstract
We describe the outcome of a data challenge to detect signals of new physics at the LHC using unsupervised machine learning algorithms conducted as part of the
[Dark Machines initiative](https://www.darkmachines.org).
We first define and describe a large benchmark dataset, consisting of $>1$ Billion simulated LHC events corresponding to 10 fb^{-1} of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. We then review a wide range of anomaly detection and density estimation algorithms, developed in the context of the data challenge, and we measure their performance in a set of realistic analysis environments. We draw a number of useful conclusions that will aid the development of unsupervised new physics searches during the third run of the LHC, and provide our benchmark dataset for future studies at [phenoMLdata](https://www.phenoMLdata.org).
